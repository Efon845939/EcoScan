/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for EcoScan Rewards
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can read and write their own
 * data, but cannot modify critical, admin-controlled fields like 'roles' or 'isDisabled'. Public data is read-only.
 * @data_structure The data is organized hierarchically:
 *   - /users/{userId}: User profile information, owned by the user with matching UID.
 *   - /verificationCodes/{codeId}: Server-side only collection for OTPs. No client access.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User profiles are strictly owned by the user, enforced through path-based authorization.
 *   - Users cannot modify their own roles, points, or disabled status.
 *   - Listing of all users is disallowed to protect user privacy.

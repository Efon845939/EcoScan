/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EcoScan Rewards.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and transactions,
 * while allowing public read access to recycling bins and partner stores.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - User transactions are stored in `/users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}`.
 * - Recycling bins are stored in `/recycling_bins/{binId}`.
 * - Partner stores are stored in `/partner_stores/{storeId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Recycling bins and partner stores are publicly readable but not writable.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase, focusing only on
 *   ownership and relational integrity.

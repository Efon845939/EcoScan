/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for EcoScan Rewards
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and transactions,
 * with public read access for recycling bins and partner stores. It prioritizes security and performance
 * by using path-based authorization and data denormalization to avoid costly `get()` calls.
 * @data_structure The data is organized hierarchically:
 *   - /users/{userId}: User profile information, owned by the user with matching UID.
 *   - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Transaction history for each user, also owned by the user.
 *   - /recycling_bins/{binId}: Information about recycling bins, publicly readable.
 *   - /partner_stores/{storeId}: Information about partner stores, publicly readable.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User profiles and transactions are strictly owned by the user, enforced through path-based authorization.
 *   - Listing of all users is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 *   - Recycling bins and partner stores are publicly readable, assuming this data is not sensitive.
 *   - Data validation is limited to ownership and relational integrity checks to enable rapid prototyping.
 * @denormalization The `Transaction` documents denormalize the `binId` from the `RecyclingBin` entity.
